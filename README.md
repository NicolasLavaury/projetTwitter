# Twitter Project
I made a Tiwtter clone in order to see how the Twitter homepage works.

## Why?
Since Twitter is one the biggest social networks, i made a clone of the homepage to see how it works. I wanted to make my own Twitter homepage, to add my own things.
I used HTML5 and CSS3. 

## What did I learn?

With this project i learned how to use properly flexboxes and responsives.
